This repository contains tools for the [NY Times' Wordle Game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## Word List
The file [words.txt](words.txt) contains all the possible Words in the game, stored as two Javascript arrays.  
The first array contains all the words that can appear as a solution, and the second list contains all the additional words that can be used as guesses.
These words were taken directly from the JavaScript used by the game itself.

The file [solutions.txt](solutions.txt) contains just the possible solutions, formatted as one word per line.
